## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
  The condition expression helps decide if the loop should end or continue executing.
- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?
  Initialization is evaluated before the loop starts.
- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
  The condition is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the evaluation is false then the loop ends.
- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
  The final expression is evaluated after each loop.
- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?
  The final expression is used to change control variables in a loop, like if you want to decrement/increment a counter variable.
- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?
  Data types the for...in loop should be used on are objects and their properties.
