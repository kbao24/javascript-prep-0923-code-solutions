## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the five parts of a function definition?

The five parts of a function definition are: function keyword, function name, parameters separated by commas and surrounded by parentheses, curly braces to indicate start of a code block, optional return statement, and ending curly brace to indicate end of code block.

- How do you call a function?
  You can call a function by first defining a function and then writing out the function name with two parentheses () next to it to call the function.
- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
  A parameter is a placeholder whose value is unknown until we call the function. An argument is what you actually pass in through the function. The main difference is that we declare parameters and when we call functions, we pass in arguments.
