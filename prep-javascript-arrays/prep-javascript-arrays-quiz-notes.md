## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the principal use of arrays?
  The principal use of arrays is to store data in a list that is numerically indexed. This means they are stored in a set order under their "index." You can store multiple items under a single variable name.
- Describe the syntax (structure) of array-literals in JavaScript.
  The syntax of an array-literal would be to first set a variable name of the array. Then set the array variable equal to a set of square brackets. Inside the square brackets, you want to write the items you want to store in the variable, each separated by a comma while surrounded by quotation marks so they are in string form.
- What number represents the **first** index of an array?
  The number 0 always represents the first index of an array

- How can you access the last element of an array?
  You can access the last element of an array by using array.length - 1
